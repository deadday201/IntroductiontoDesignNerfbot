# IntroductiontoDesignNerfbot
Repository for programming the Raspberry pi for controlling the Nerf sentry
All programs here are written in python
if you wish to compile it and run the programs successfully you will need to also have the Adafruit_MotorHAT, Adafruit_GPIO, and Adafruit_PureIO for everything to operate properly
All of those can be found and downloaded from github
Guides to everything I ussed to learn the code can be found on the project goals doc on the team drive
